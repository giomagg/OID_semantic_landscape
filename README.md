# Informatin and Democracy Semantic Landscape

This repository provides access to the code used to produce the OID semantic landscape.

What is it?

The OID semantic landscape is an interactive visualisation of the topics covered in the literature analysed in the report. It can be used to efficiently explore, search and filter the sources we cited, and find academic evidence for research, communication, and policymaking. It is an alternative tool to visualise and search our interactive library on information ecosystems and democracy, making it easy and intuitive to access our expert-curated literature.
