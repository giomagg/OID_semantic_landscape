This repository provides access to the code used to produce the OID semantic landscape. See the interactive visualization at <https://observatory.informationdemocracy.org/report-literature/>. The literature used to produce the map is available as a `bib` file at <https://observatory.informationdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/report_bibliography.bib>

The map was produced thanks to: 
1. `Datamapplot`: <https://datamapplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
2. `Sentence Tranformers`: <https://www.sbert.net>
3. `UMAP`: <https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>

## Introduction to the OID semantic landscape

### What is it?

The OID semantic landscape is an interactive visualisation of the topics covered in the literature analysed in the report. It can be used to efficiently explore, search and filter the sources we cited, and find academic evidence for research, communication, and policymaking. It is an alternative tool to visualise and search our interactive library on information ecosystems and democracy, making it easy and intuitive to access our expert-curated literature. 

### How does it work ?

Each point of the map represents a paper that the OID analysed organised by topic and subtopic. You can explore the map by zooming in and out and dragging it around. The colors represent macro-topics and are supposed to help you orient yourself and find what you need. The more you zoom in, the more sub-topics you will be able to see. Hover over any point to see the titles, authors, and region, and click to open the resource in a new google tab.

You can also navigate the map using the filters and search bar. When activated they highlight those sources that correspond to the selected parameters: 
1. The regional filter allows you to select sources based on the origin of the study. You can select more than one area at the same time.
2. The publication year filter, which allows you to select sources based on when they were published. You can drag the filter to dynamically select more years and move the window through time.
3. You can also target your search using the search bar on the top left. Type a word or sentence you are interested in and the map will display those sources containing the word in their title.
